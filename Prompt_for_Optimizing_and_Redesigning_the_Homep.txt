Prompt for Optimizing and Redesigning the Homepage of https://lamgame.vn/

Objective:
The website https://lamgame.vn/ aims to be a Game Dev Hub focused on:
- Job postings from game companies (e.g., VNG, Gameloft).
- Blogs, game sources (e.g., GitHub repos), and game ideas shared by game developers.
- Active forum topics with high comment flow and recent updates.

Current homepage issues:
- Primarily promotional for courses (Unity, Unreal Engine, C#), with static stats (e.g., '0 Học viên', placeholders).
- Lacks real job listings, developer shares, and forum feeds.
- Structure: Header with hero banner, featured courses, reasons to choose, success stories (incomplete), footer.
- No dynamic elements, poor community engagement.

Redesign Guidelines:
Transform from a course-selling landing page to a community-driven hub. Prioritize community content (70%) over education (30%). Use responsive design (e.g., Next.js/Bootstrap). Ensure SEO for keywords like 'việc làm game dev Việt Nam', 'source code Unity', 'ý tưởng game'.

1. Header (Fixed Top):
   - Logo: 'Làm Game'.
   - Navigation Menu: Home | Việc Làm | Blog/Shares | Forum | Khóa Học.
